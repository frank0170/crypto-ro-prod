    "description": "Cardano (ADA) is a decentralized platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion. It is reportedly the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach, and one of the first to be built in the Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed.  The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers. The protocol reportedly features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. Cardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a treasury system.",

Bakers put up deposits and are rewarded for signing and publishing blocks. Witnesses then validate the blocks. Dishonest bakers lose their XTZ deposits. Tezos uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) and supports Turing complete smart contracts. Tezos is implemented in the OCaml programming language, which is said to offer 'functional, imperative, and object-oriented styles'.",

Since blockchains cannot access data outside their network, oracles are needed to function as data feeds in smart contracts. Oracles provide external data (e.g. temperature, weather) that trigger smart contract executions upon the fulfillment of pre-defined conditions. Participants on the Chainlink network are incentivized (through rewards) to provide smart contracts with access to external data feeds. Should users desire access to off-chain data, they can submit a requesting contract to ChainLink’s network. These contracts will match the requesting contract with the appropriate oracles. The contracts include a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The aggregating contract gathers data of the selected oracles to find the most accurate result.",

    "description": "Launched in 2015, Nano (formerly RaiBlocks) describes itself as an open source, sustainable, and secure next-generation digital currency focused on removing perceived inefficiencies present in existing cryptocurrencies. Designed to solve peer to peer transfer of value, Nano aims to revolutionize the world economy through an ultrafast and fee-less network that is open and accessible to everyone. \r\n\r\nNano is reportedly able to offer fast and feeless transactions due to the Block Lattice - a data structure in which all accounts each have their own blockchain, rather than competing with others on a central chain. Consensus is generated through representative voting, where accounts can freely choose their representative at any time with an update of their account chain, thereby providing more control for users to decide who validates transactions.\r\n\r\nEach component of the protocol was created with the long term goals of decentralization and accessibility in mind. By creating a system where representatives are not paid to operate, the incentive to participate in the network is shifted to indirect, operational cost savings. The team claims that this change in incentive model is more efficient and removes one of the factors driving centralization in other systems because participants are not encouraged to interact beyond their direct needs and supporting the network, and thus economies of scale become less critical.",

This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain. The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits. Holochain Dapps can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.",

Although based on Bitcoin, adjustments in the code reportedly allow for improved functionality, including 15-second block time, real-time difficulty adjustment and improved security. DigiByte development has included DigiShield, MultiAlgo, MultiShield, SegWit, and Odocrypt. \r\n\r\nDigiByte claims to have never been funded through an ICO, presale, or token sale. DGB is the Digital Asset/ Cryptocurrency with a 1000:1 ratio to BTC that is being mined over 21 years (2014-2035) with a max supply of 21B in the year 2035. DigiAssets was designed to allow users to build on top of DigiByte as a secondary layer on top of the global DigiByte blockchain to enable the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, and digital identity.\r\n\r\nDigiByte claims to have had 280,000 full node downloads since 2017. As of 21 August 2019. 12,000 nodes are reportedly active and the network is distributed by 5 parallel cryptographic hashing algorithms (PoW) which secure the network. DigiByte claims to have 15-second block timings. With DigiSpeed, DigiByte can reportedly scale onchain with 560 TPS now and aims to attain 280,000 TPS in 2035 with low fees.",

Transaction speed on Verge is estimated to be at 5 seconds due to the use of Simple Payment Verification (SPV). The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration and SSL encryption which obfuscates the IP addresses of users. The introduction of the Wraith Protocol upgrade enables users to send and receive payments privately across the Verge blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services. Verge users are reportedly able to switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain.

Sharding is analogous to the concept of 'divide and conquer', where transactions are divided into smaller groups for miners to perform parallel transactional verification. The upshot of this is the ability to reach consensus more quickly, which would increase the number of transactions in a given period. According to the white paper, transactions speed could scale to approximately 1000x that of Ethereum's network. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that developers can focus on fleshing out their ideas rather than worrying about network congestion. ",

It was founded in 2017, and seeks to eliminate inefficiencies in the crypto market by increasing scalability of smart contracts and dApps, sharding, and off-chain contract execution. The Turing-complete smart contracts on the Aeternity chain allow for transaction execution without third parties or intermediaries. Aeternity also has state channels to enable off-chain smart contract settlements which only touch the blockchain should a disagreement in the contract arise, acting as a self-arbitrating crypto court. The Aeternity blockchain is also built upon state-of-the-art cryptographic data structures which give rise to robust efficiency, strong security, and the elimination “single point of failure” (SPOF) issues.",

Founded in 2016 by Ned Scott and BitShares creator Dan Larimer, the Steemit platform, built atop the Steem blockchain, is a social media network that seeks to be a source of community-driven curated content such as news, Q&A and job boards. The more value a particular piece of content is able to deliver across a greater number of people, the greater the reward received by the creator. Steemit users can cast votes to create a hierarchy of content. The higher the upvote count received on a content piece, the more Steem is earned by its publisher. Steemit’s meritocratic system also enables users that hold more currency to cast more meaningful, greater influence votes. ",

Green and graduate students Ian Miers and Christina Garman as an extension to the Bitcoin protocol that would add cryptographic anonymity to Bitcoin transactions. With Zcoin’s Zerocoin feature, only the sender and receive would be able to ascertain the exchange of funds in a given transaction, as no transaction histories are linked to the actual coins. Zcoin operates a multi-node model where mining nodes verify blockchain transactions and Znodes store blockchain data.",

The custom features and incentive mechanisms developed by WAX are designed to optimize the blockchain’s usability in e-commerce, and encourage voting on guilds and proposals.\r\n\r\nWAX claims to have created a suite of blockchain-based tools upon which dApps, marketplaces, and native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are built. These tools would include services to support e-commerce operations such as an interactive block explorer, wallet, SSO and OAUTH, item creation, an RNG service, interactive item viewers, marketplace creation, and more. The resulting technology represents a blockchain architecture that is reportedly fast (500 millisecond block times), fee-less for customers, less expensive for developers, and leverages voting rewards to incentivize participation in the selection of block producers and proposals.",
